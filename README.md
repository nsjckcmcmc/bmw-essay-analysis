Introduction
This essay aims to provide an assessment and analysis of the organisational structure, the external business environment, and the ethics of the BMW Group - one of the world's leading manufacturers of premium and luxury cars. This essay elaborates on the company's structure and governance, external environmental challenges, and the ethical implications of its decision-making regarding its stakeholder groups. Founded in 1916, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW Group) is a German automotive company that produces luxury vehicles and motorcycles. It distributes its products under the BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce brands. It is a publicly traded company, with the Quandt family owning about 46% of the shares. As of the present, the BMW Group has a total workforce of over 159,000 people worldwide and generated around €153.23 billion in revenue, maintaining a strong foothold in Europe, China, and the US (Inagaki, 2025). German luxury carmaker BMW sold over 2.55 million vehicles globally in 2024, capturing the top position in the premium segment. The essay will first conduct a critical analysis of BMW’s corporate structure and controls, and then provide a detailed study of the external business environment using the PESTLE framework. Finally, the ethical behaviours towards the major stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the planet, will be measured by referring to Carroll’s Pyramid.
The main body paragraphs
Organisational structure of the BMW Group
An organisational structure describes how processes such as task allocation, coordination and supervision are directed towards the achievement of organisational goals. It depicts the order, direction, and avenues of communication, as well as the authority relationships within an organisation. The BMW Group employs a matrix structure, comprising multiple flexible teams of experts in various fields of expertise. This means the organisation is product-line-based (such as BMW, MINI, and Rolls-Royce) and function-based (such as engineering, sales, marketing, and finance), leaving greater control over increasingly complex global operations (Lechner, 2024).
Flexibility and innovation - with BMW, these are two significant advantages of the matrix structure. For instance, the company’s ability to orchestrate the creation of the electric BMW i-series has demonstrated that it can leverage insights from multiple functions, such as R&D, sustainability, and production. The matrix organisation fosters cross-functional cooperation, a crucial capability in the rapidly changing automotive sector. It enables global planning while allowing local markets the independence to adjust strategies to their own needs. BMW’s regional centres of competence, such as those in Europe, China, and the US, for example, highlight the role decentralised decision-making has played in enabling the brand to compete effectively in very different parts of the world (Mullins and McLean, 2019).
Second, it promotes specialisation - employees can be accountable to both functional and product managers and acquire more specialised skills as they become increasingly proficient in their job. According to Inagaki (2025), the BMW Group had an R&D spend of €7.538 billion in 2023, up 13.8% year-over-year. This over €6 billion investment, for the third consecutive year, represents a 5% R&D ratio. Although 2024’s numbers are not yet available, that trend is expected to continue with the industry’s dedication to technological and innovation advancements. These investment projects, such as the Neue Klasse EV-Plattform, were only made possible through its disciplined and bold approach. However, there are glaring flaws. Matrix organisations are dual-reporting, and situations of conflict and misunderstandings become the order of the day. There may be a conflict between the functional manager and the project manager, causing inefficiencies and slowing down decision-making. In a firm as large as BMW, this may lead to bureaucratic sluggishness, especially for product launches in several thousand markets. Furthermore, integrated global team and department coordination can lead to higher administrative costs and communication challenges, particularly due to time zone and cultural differences. The matrix structure of BMW enables the company to achieve innovation, market responsiveness, and functional excellence. However, to stay nimble in what is becoming a digital and sustainable automotive marketplace, the company also needs to continue fine-tuning its internal communication processes and decision-making efficiency to minimise the downsides of structural complexity.
 
External business factors impacting the performance and operations of the company with PESTEL analysis
BMW Group is subject to intense global competition, with its structure, business and results affected by a variety of external factors. The PESTEL analysis – which includes Political, Economic, Socio-cultural, Technological, Environmental, and Legal factors – allows for a detailed examination of such external forces.
Political: BMW’s global business is influenced by political conditions. The UK's exit from the EU (Brexit) has introduced uncertainties regarding BMW’s MINI production in Oxford, which is highly dependent on parts from EU countries. New tariffs and customs checks may disrupt the smooth operation of its just-in-time production system, leading to increased costs and production glitches. Approximately half of the vehicles assembled in the UK are exported to the EU (Nerlich, 2023), making BMW's operations vulnerable to post-Brexit trade barriers. Moreover, China’s policy support for electric vehicles is altering global auto strategies. In turn, BMW has increased its cooperation with China-based BMW Brilliance to expand its electric vehicle (EV) presence in line with the desired government mandate.
Economic: BWM is in the premium car business, which is less affected by small economic downturns. However, manufacturing costs have been impacted by global inflation, increased interest rates, and higher raw material expenses. There is also intense economic fallout from Brexit - estimates suggest that producing a car could cost 10% more, making BMW MINI less profitable. At the same time, there are opportunities for growth in the developing world. As Pott (2023) also notes, car ownership across the BRIC group of countries has increased, and BMW has taken action by expanding its dealership network and increasing local production in China, India, and Brazil to meet demand.
Social: Changing consumer tastes are factors related to culture or social preference, such as fuel-efficient cars (C) in the Market's components. Rapidly increasing environmental consciousness, especially in urban areas, has driven up demand for electric vehicles. BMW's luxury car image is also attractive to status-conscious consumers in both developed and developing countries. The company is emphasising innovation and exclusivity in its marketing strategies. This stance aligns with the interests of an expanding, middle-class population in places such as India and China. These booming economies are expected to be key players in the luxury car market over the next decade (Lechner, 2024).
Technology: Technology is also a key component of BMW's competitive advantage. The business is recognised for its exceptional engineering and ongoing dedication to research and development. In 2023, BMW invested more than €7.538 billion in R&D to develop EV technology, autonomous driving, and digital services (Moss, 2024). New technologies, such as the “Neue Klasse” EV platform and collaborations in solid-state battery technology, are proof that BMW is dedicated to future mobility leadership. The digitalised services, including the My BMW app and software updates, are another showcase of the company’s move towards a more connected customer experience.
Legal: Legal aspects affect BMW's business, including trade laws, environmental regulations, and safety laws. Post-Brexit trade barriers imply more compliance, while EU emission laws and China’s EV mandates require BMW to conduct extensive due diligence (documents are under interpretation). It is also under regulatory pressure to slash fleet-wide emissions or face penalties.
Environmental: Environmental and moral considerations are becoming increasingly relevant. There is growing pressure from consumers and governments for greener practices. BMW has committed to reducing carbon emissions by 40% throughout the vehicle's life cycle by 2030 and is focusing on the use of recycled materials. These sustainability initiatives help to meet green expectations, while also building brand image and driving competitive advantage in a value-driven marketplace.
Ethical responsibilities of the BMW Group towards its stakeholders using Carroll’s Pyramid
The BMW Group is committed to CSR responsibility in all its processes: throughout the product life cycle, commercial and business processes, and in cooperation with its suppliers and partners. These responsibilities are well analysed by Carroll’s Pyramid of CSR, which classifies corporate duties into four categories: economic, legal, ethical, and philanthropic responsibilities (Mullins and McLean, 2019).
Economic Responsibility: At the bottom of the pyramid are the basic, foundational economic responsibilities. BMW’s primary responsibility is to consistently remain profitable and achieve long-term value creation for our shareholders, employees, business partners, and customers. This economic objective is driven by the firm’s strategy, centred on the goal of maintaining “technical superiority” through continued emphasis on research and development (R&D) investment. For 2023, BMW invested €7.538 billion in R&D to advance the standards of electric mobility and digital innovation (Moss, 2024).
Legal Responsibility: Further up the responsibility chain, legal responsibilities refer to a business's obligation to comply with the law, both domestically and internationally. BMW faces a patchwork of laws in the 140 countries in which it operates (Needle and Burns, 2019). Brexit was a legal and operational challenge for BMW, especially regarding the production of the MINI in the UK. New checks for customs and the potential for tariffs have cluttered the formerly seamless flow of components, and BMW had no choice but to reassess its logistics and supply chain to ensure compliance. Moreover, BMW must adhere to increasingly stringent emission rules, such as the EU’s CO₂ standards and China’s New Energy Vehicle (NEV) policies, which compel companies by law to produce less-polluting cars.
Ethical Responsibility: The third layer, ethical duties, encompasses community norms that extend beyond the law. With an increasing awareness of environmental concerns, pressure on the automotive industry grows to act responsibly. BMW replied by pledging to cut CO₂ emissions from 3 million vehicles by 40% over their entire life cycle by 2030 (Reuters, 2021). This involves the use of recycled materials, reducing dependence on rare earth metals, and investing in battery recycling. This is leadership of a new morality, guided by what the society around demands, not what the law “writes.” Moreover, BMW’s approach of “profitable business is ethically responsible business” highlights that doing the right thing enhances its brand and fosters loyal customers in the long run.
Philanthropy Responsibility: Philanthropic duties count at the peak, for they are voluntary, but they serve to promote corporate social standing and goodwill among multiple stakeholders. Although not elaborated on in the given sources here, BMW has several initiatives in the real world, such as the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt, which supports and provides leadership skills for social change worldwide. BMW is also a supporter of environmental education, STEM initiatives, and mobility access programs, a sign of its greater commitment to the well-being of society at large (Pott, 2023).
BMW’s stakeholders' responsibilities encompass financial results, legal and ethical performance, and social contributions, without expectations. The Carroll model illustrates that there are several levels of corporate social responsibility, with the first level being business-oriented. BMW integrates all these CSR responsibilities into a single global system, where profit aligns with ethical and social impact.
Conclusion
This essay has taken an analytical look at the organisational structure, external business environment, and ethical obligations of the BMW Group. BMW operates a function-within-a-product divisional form that encourages product innovation and global coordination, but often at the expense of slower decision-making and higher bureaucratic costs. The company faces an uncertain external environment, characterised by political uncertainties such as Brexit, rapid technological development, increasing environmental legislation, and shifting customer preferences. A PESTEL analysis demonstrated how these factors influence BMW’s strategic decisions, particularly in its drive towards electric mobility and sustainability. From an ethical standpoint, with the help of Carroll’s Pyramid of CSR, BMW demonstrates firm commitments in the areas of economic performance, law abidance, and ethical leadership, particularly in environmental protection, as well as involvement in commendable philanthropic campaigns.
BMW demonstrates commendable performance, there remains considerable potential for further improvement and positive development.
Improve structural agility through decentralisation: BMW needs to give greater freedom to regional units to make decisions, particularly in fast-growing markets such as Asia. This would lead to better response rates to local customer requirements and an increase in competitive advantage.
Accelerate investment in emerging markets and new technologies: To further expand in BRIC countries that are still growing, and focus on more affordable electric car models. It would, at the same time, deal with both economic and environmental issues.
Enhance stakeholder participation in sustainability reporting: BMW also needs to strengthen stakeholder engagement as part of its sustainability strategy development. This engagement should be based on selected, fixed, and quantitative criteria outlined in its annual CSR reports to earn trust and accountability.
